It's so hard to take the trap out a trap nigga
I'm coke dealer dressed like a rap figure
A Guy Fisher type of nigga, I'ma die richer
Posing for pictures with the strippers and the pie flippers
I'd rather lie to you, baby' than to lie with you
I seen you with it, shit, I ain't finna ride with you
Pitching underhand' I'm a knuckleball pitcher
You're off base, I call you out, I'm the hind catcher
You ran off, guess you thought it'd be a cake walk
Stealing base, got caught, let the K talk
Got me diggin' in my safe at the safehouse
Like I won't pay a hundred K to blow your face off (Wop)

The young nigga stay fresh
I could show 'em how to flex
Another nigga with a check
And I could teach him how to dress
The young nigga stay fresh
And I could show 'em how to flex
Another nigga with a check
I got motherfuckin' racks (Cash, hmm)
Another young nigga with a fuckin' check, yeah

Big rocks hurt my neck, yeah (Big rocks)
Big watch got baguettes, yeah
First young nigga in the hood in that 'Vette, yeah
Free Ralo, we keep dog, we call it pet, yeah (Free Ralo)
Bitch, my son got racks, hah
Wop had dropped that sack, facts
But my brother still trappin' that pack (Them facts)
In that Benz truck, all black
Bitch, I do this shit, no practice
I just fucked on her, no strings attached
Project baby, when I was born, nigga, my system already had crack
Sell you a verse, still beat that pack
I used to pray for the drip, now I pull up, hop out fresh
Them 1'5 niggas, they blessed
Hop off a jet, go straight to a check
Make that Hellcat make a mess
Bitch, I'm rich, I'm not pressed
Nigga tried, like my money, he got stretched
Bitch, I come from nothing, yes
Ask 'bout my life, bet they tell you...

The young nigga stay fresh (Drip, drip)
I could show 'em how to flex (Yeah, mhm)
Another nigga with a check (Cash)
And I could teach him how to dress (Put this shit on)
The young nigga stay fresh (Yeah)
And I could show 'em how to flex (Flex, flex)
Another nigga with a check
I got motherfuckin' racks (Hmm)
Another young nigga with a fuckin' check
